## Directory structure and best practices

The `src/mcp-prod-server` directory contains a production grade implementation of an MCP server. The code is organized as follows:
- `config/`: Configuration files for different environments (development, staging, production).
- `src/`: Source code for the MCP server, basically the business logic.
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
- `mcp_server.py`: The main entry point for the MCP server application.
- `Dockerfile`: Docker configuration for containerizing the MCP server.
- `README.md`: This readme file providing an overview of the project.
